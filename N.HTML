A home away from home, the hostels at VIT is more than four walls and a roof. They have been designed to provide a comfortable, safe, inclusive and secure living even as they provide opportunities to form lasting friendships and ease the transition from home to college. Residential staff is always available to support the students from different backgrounds to promote community. Living on campus provides students with opportunities to:

<br>
<br>
<pre>
* Connect with a diverse population of people
* Develop stronger interpersonal and communication skills
* Engage in campus leadership, organizations and activities
* Establish relationships with faculty and staff members
</pre>
Hostel review committee meetings are conducted once in <font color="Red">15 days </font>by the hostel administrators to address studentsâ€™ queries and requirements, and to keep them updated on upgradation of services and events. Students are also given the privilege to give suggestions to improve the hostel facilities.
